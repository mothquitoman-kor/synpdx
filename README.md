# synpdx

synpdx is an R package for nonlinear mixed-effects (NLME) modeling and interaction analysis in in vivo patient-derived xenograft (PDX) combination studies.  
It fits tumor growth and drug-effect models, computes subject-level interaction distances (Dᵢ), and performs chi-square and bootstrap hypothesis testing to classify synergism, additivity, or antagonism.
