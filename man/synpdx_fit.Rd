\usage{
synpdx_fit(
  dat,
  control,
  drug_a,
  drug_b,
  combo,
  B = 100,
  out_dir = NULL,
  seed = 990202,
  cutoff = c("auto", "none"),
  model = c("auto", "exp_const", "exp_decay", "gomp_const", "gomp_decay",
    "logistic_const", "logistic_decay"),
  select_random_effects = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dat}{A data.frame containing:
\itemize{
\item subject: character or coercible identifier for each PDX model
\item time: numeric observation time
\item treatment: character treatment arm label (must contain the four arm names below)
\item logvol_norm: numeric log-transformed tumor volume
Indicators I_A and I_B are computed internally.
}}

\item{control}{Character. Label of the control arm in \code{treatment} (e.g., "control").}

\item{drug_a}{Character. Label of the monotherapy A arm (e.g., "BYL719").}

\item{drug_b}{Character. Label of the monotherapy B arm (e.g., "binimetinib").}

\item{combo}{Character. Label of the combination arm (e.g., "combination").}

\item{B}{Integer ≥1. Number of bootstrap replicates. Default is 100.}

\item{out_dir}{NULL or character path. If not NULL, CSV and PNG outputs are written there.}

\item{seed}{Integer random seed. Default is 990202.}

\item{cutoff}{One of c("auto","none").
\itemize{
\item "auto": predictions in the combination arm are truncated at the smallest last-time point
shared across all four arms (control, A, B, combination).
\item "none": use all available time points.
}}

\item{model}{One of c("auto","exp_const","exp_decay","gomp_const","gomp_decay","logistic_const","logistic_decay").
\itemize{
\item "auto": all six models are fitted and compared by BIC; the one with lowest BIC is chosen.
\item Otherwise, the specified model is used directly.
}}

\item{select_random_effects}{Logical.
\itemize{
\item TRUE: perform backward likelihood ratio tests for random-effect selection using backward_selection_saemix.
\item FALSE: skip selection and use a diagonal covariance (one random effect per parameter).
In either case, if model="auto", the final decision among six models is based on BIC.
}}
}
\value{
A list with components:
\itemize{
\item fit: synpdx_fit object (selected model and saemix result)
\item plot: ggplot object from synpdx_plot_individual
\item Di: list from synpdx_compute_Di
\item chisq: list from synpdx_chisq_test
\item bootstrap: list from synpdx_bootstrap
}
}
\description{
This high-level wrapper performs:
\enumerate{
\item fitting of an NLME tumor-growth and drug-effect model on control and monotherapy data,
\item prediction and distance computation (D_i) for the combination arm,
\item chi-square additivity testing, and
\item bootstrap testing of standardized signed distances.
}

\details{
Input data must already include a log-scale response column named \code{logvol_norm}.
